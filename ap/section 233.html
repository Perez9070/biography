    <h2><u>BIOGRAPY</u></h2>
      My name is Perez Abel,  I'm really into tech right now and diving into cloud engineering at AltSchool. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can change the world, and cloud computing feels like the perfect place to make a real impact. The idea that businesses can run seamlessly with the right cloud infrastructure—whether it’s improving efficiency, cutting costs, or making tech more accessible—really excites me.

At AltSchool, I’m i am now Familiarizing with html . What’s been most exciting for me is the hands-on learning. I’ve had the chance to learn html, collaborating with peers and instructors to solve real-world problems.  It’s these kinds of projects that make the concepts stick and give me a taste of what it’s like to apply theory in a real-world setting.

For me, the best part of cloud engineering is the constant innovation. It’s a field that never stops evolving, and I’m always excited to learn about the latest tools and technologies. I’m especially interested in how cloud computing is reshaping industries like healthcare and finance, making them more efficient and secure.

Looking ahead, my goal is to land a cloud engineering role where I can contribute to building scalable, reliable systems that help organizations thrive. I’m driven, but I know that the road to getting there takes continuous learning and growth. That’s why I’m not just focused on gaining technical skills—I’m also sharpening my problem-solving abilities and my ability to collaborate with teams, because I believe those skills are just as important in this field.
